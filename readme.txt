== Description ==

A sidebar widget plugin which displays the prices of Bitcoin for four of the most popular exchange websites.

* BTC China
* MT Gox
* BTC-e
* Bitstamp

It is installed exactly like a normal plugin through the admin area. 

Prices are live for each individual exchange website, therefore if the website is down for any reason no results will update or show for the specific exchange.  The widget allows you to change show or hide different exchanges in the settings menu.

The widget will automatically update with the current price of Bitcoin.
